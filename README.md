# Customer Churn Prediction in the Telecommunication Industry  
### Using Machine Learning and GenAI-Driven Optimisation

---

##  Overview  
This project replicates and extends the study by **Nguyen, Tran, & Dao (2022)** on predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry using **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**.  
The goal is to identify customers at risk of leaving by comparing and optimising multiple models, focusing on **recall** ‚Äî the most important metric for business retention decisions.

The project evaluates and improves several models:
- **Logistic Regression** (baseline interpretability)
- **Decision Tree** (non-linear interpretability)
- **Random Forest** (ensemble learning)
- - **Neural Network**
- **Baseline comparison: SVM (Nguyen et al., 2022)**

Further refinements included:
- **Hyperparameter tuning** via `GridSearchCV`  
- **Feature selection** (forward selection)  
- **Nested Cross-Validation** for unbiased evaluation  
- **Regularisation via pruning**  
- **SMOTE** for class rebalancing  
- **GenAI guidance** (ChatGPT-5) for workflow optimisation and implementation feedback

##  Objective  
To identify a **reliable and interpretable churn prediction model** that maximises **recall**, ensuring customers likely to churn are accurately identified, even at the cost of minor precision or accuracy trade-offs.
